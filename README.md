# K-WatchManager | Android
I'm converting [this cli application](https://github.com/su-Kaizen/K-WatchManager) into an android app using Kotlin (No Jetpack Compose).

After months the app is working fine with the same features as the desktop version. The issues of saving and loading watches correctly has been a headache, something that took me no more than 10 minutes in Java.
